# 3D Scanner App

**3D Scanner App** is an iOS application that uses LiDAR and photogrammetry to create 3D scans.

The app was tested to create 3D models using a LiDAR device.

This example shows two different scan outputs of a turtle statue captured using the app â€” one in mesh format (.glb) and one as a point cloud (.ply).
