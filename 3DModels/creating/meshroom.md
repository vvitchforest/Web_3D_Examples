## Info

Photogrammetry is a technique that creates a 3D model from multiple images. In this example, 50 images were captured with an iPhone SE and processed using Meshroom, an open-source 3D reconstruction software by the AliceVision Association.

## Working Process

1. 58 images of an object were taken from different angles without moving the object. Images were taken in natural light with black background.
2. The images were converted to JPG format and uploaded to Meshroom for reconstruction. For more details, see the [Meshroom photogrammetry pipeline](https://alicevision.org/#photogrammetry).
3. The resulting mesh was cleaned up in Blender and exported in GLB format.
4. The 3D model uploaded to sketchfab for viewing.
