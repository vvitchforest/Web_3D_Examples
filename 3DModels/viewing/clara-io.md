## Info

### Used

- **Photogrammetry**
- **Left:** Qlone mobile app for Android/iOS (free with limits)
- **Middle:** 3D Live Scanner (early access) for Android (free with advertisements)
- **Right:** Metascan for iOS (also LiDAR scan option, free with limits)
- Printed out Qlone mat, size A3
- Clara.io web-app with free plan

### Working Process

- A 3D toy bunny figure was made using photogrammetry with 3 different mobile applications for comparison.
- GLB files were sent to the computer. For the Qlone model, the OBJ file had to be downloaded and converted to GLB in Blender because Clara.io gave an error when downloading the Qlone model directly in GLB format.
- One model was uploaded to Clara.io, the editor was opened, and other models were imported into the scene.
- Some adjustments were made in the Clara.io editor. Their editor is very advanced, though it can be a bit confusing at first.
- The iframe link was added to the website.

### Where to Use

- Online stores to present the product and give a better idea of the product.
- Share your 3D scanned objects.
