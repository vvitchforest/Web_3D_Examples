# Model-viewer

**Model Viewer** is an open-source web component that makes it easy to display and interact with 3D models on a webpage using HTML.  
It uses WebGL under the hood and provides features like lighting, camera control, and AR support via the `<model-viewer>` tagâ€”without requiring libraries like Three.js or Babylon.js.

[**Model-viewer Editor**](https://modelviewer.dev/editor) is a browser-based tool for customizing and previewing models. It generates ready-to-use code snippets with support for AR and various rendering options.
