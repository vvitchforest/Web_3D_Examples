## Info

Sketchfab is a web-based viewer for 3D, virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR) content.
The viewer is based on WebGL ad WebXR technologies that allows 3D models to be viewed in browser on desktop, mobile or VR headset.
The platform allows you to view, share, and embed 3D assets.  
In this example, it was used to display a model created with photogrammetry.
