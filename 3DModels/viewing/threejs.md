# Three.js

**Three.js** is a JavaScript library that uses WebGL to render 3D graphics in the browser. It handles managing scenes, lights, cameras, materials, and animations. It also supports **post-processing**, which means you can apply visual effects like bloom, depth of field, and color adjustments after rendering the scene. It also includes **WebXRManager**, which can be used to create augmented or virtual reality experiences, but it is currently not supported on iOS devices, due to its realiance on WebXR API.

Three.js is also compatible with **React** through libraries like `react-three-fiber`.
