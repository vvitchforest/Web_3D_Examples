# Matterport

**Matterport** is a platform that turns real-world spaces into interactive 3D models and virtual tours using 360° scans. It works with cameras like the Matterport Pro2, which capture detailed spatial data that's processed in the cloud to generate immersive experiences.

Additional information (such as annotations) can be added using Matterport's cloud tools, and virtual tours can be embedded on websites.

Even with a paid subscription, exporting the 3D model incurs an extra fee.

Matterport also provides APIs and SDKs for integrating tours into third-party platforms, but these developer tools require a specific license.
