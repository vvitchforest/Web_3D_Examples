## Info

Metareal Virtual Tour uses 360° images and the Metareal Stage web-editor to create immersive virtual tours. In this process, a Matterport Pro2 camera captures 360° images that are then downloaded from the Matterport cloud and uploaded to Metareal Stage, where they are aligned and connected to form an interactive tour.

## Working Process

1. 360° images were taken with a Matterport camera at the Metropolia Karamalmi campus.
2. The images were downloaded from the Matterport cloud and uploaded to Metareal Stage.
3. A tour was created by selecting a reference panorama, aligning it to the world grid, leveling it, drawing the floor outline, and aligning the other panoramas to the reference.
4. Although objects, doors, and windows can be marked for a more accurate floor plan, this step was skipped.
5. The panoramas were then connected using the tour editor.
