**Pannellum** is an open-source panorama viewer library that enables lightweight virtual tours using 360° images. Pannellum is used to create virtual tours by converting 360° images (taken with any 3D camera) into cube images and then stitching them into an interactive panorama.

## Working Process

1. Pictures were taken with a Garmin Virb 360 camera at the Metropolia Karamalmi campus.
2. 360° images were converted using a sphere-to-cube converter into cube images (back, down, front, left, right, top).
3. A panorama was created with the Pannellum panorama viewer library.
4. Hotspots were added for interactivity.
